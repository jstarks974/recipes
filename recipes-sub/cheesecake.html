        <p>A delicious and traditional New York style cheesecake recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>For the crust:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs from 12 whole crackers</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>32oz of cream cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice, from 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Equipment:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>10-inch springform pan</li>
            <li>18-inch heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
            <li>Large roasting pan with dimensions greater than 11x11 inches (big enough to fit the springform inside)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <h4>Preparing the crust</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and place an oven
                rack in the lower-middle position</li>
            <li>Wrap the springform pan in one large piece of aluminum foil,
                covering the underside and extending all the way to the top
                so that there are no seams on the bottom or sides of the pan</li>
            <li>Repeat the above step with another piece of aluminum foil for insurance</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine crushed graham crackers, melted butter, sugar, 
                and salt. Stir until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Spray the inside of the springform pan with non-stick cooking spray. Then,
                press the graham cracker crumb mixture into an even layer on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Bake the crust for 10 minutes until set. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and set a large pot of water to boil.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Preparing the filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and flour together until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, and salt. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Mix in the sour cream.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Baking the cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Check to make sure your oven has cooled to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Pour the cheesecake filling into your springform pan, smoothing out the top as necessary.</li>
            <li>Set the springform pan in a large roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the boiling water into the large roasting pan until it comes up to about
                an inch around the edge of your springform pan.</li>
            <li>Place in oven and bake until the cheesecake is just set, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the cheesecake is done, it should <em>not</em> look liquidy
                and should wobble just a little when tapped, similarly to Jell-O</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and crack the oven door. Let it cool inside the oven
                for 1 to 2 hours. Move to counter to cool an additional 45 minutes. It should
                remain inside the water bath this whole time.</li>
            <li>Once the cheesecake has finished cooling, remove it from the water bath, and remove
                the foil from the sides. Run a thin-bladed knife around the edges of the pan to
                make sure it's not sticking to the sides.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let it cool in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
        </ol>
